## Moving forward
We will be dialling back the scope of the server heavily. We have lately become
busy with real life, and cannot invest as much effort into this server as we 
used to.
  
Because of this, we'll be dialling back the scope of the server heavily. As it
stands, the factions concept will be scrapped. The dungeons will come later, 
along with all the items and enchantments we had planned.
  
The current goal for the server is a mostly vanilla survival server with custom
items, enchantments and economy features like the sign shops, admin shops and
a dedicated single area for player shops.

As it stands, we do not have the manpower (builders, developers or admins) to
truly fulfill our ambitions, and at the moment, no way of getting that much 
needed manpower.

## 1.21
I'm sorry, for the lack of updates, Terra (our world generation plugin) was 
immensely slow to update, an in fact, as of writing, still hasn't updated to 
`1.20.6`, so we'll be using a development version we compiled ourselves.
  
We will be updating once PaperMC has released a stable 1.21 build and we're sure
plugins like WorldEdit, WorldGuard and alike are up to date.
