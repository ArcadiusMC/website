The ArcadiusMC beta is dropping (or has already dropped) on the 19th of April! 
The beta server will be up for 3 to 4 weeks. The server will open for anyone
to join and fool around in!
  
**Keep in mind!** This is a beta version of the server! Restarts, hotfixes bugs
and changes will occur frequently. There may even be playerdata resets :3  

# Road map
## For the full release
Our plan for the release:
- 2 functional factions (Latins and Pirates) along with content and features 
  unique to those factions.
- A voting bank with separate vaults that can be accessed with vote tickets
  for different types of rewards.
- Custom items (with textures and models) unique to each faction and custom 
  items, general to the server.
- Custom music discs and ambience for each faction's region along with more
  lore and flavour.
- A monthly event each month to decide a new emperor/empress.

## Long term plan
- Randomly generated dungeons that can be played through like a dungeon crawler
  with custom bosses and entities.
- More factions!
  
# Hope to see you there!
But until then, here's some pretty images from the server.
