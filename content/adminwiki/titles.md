User titles are simply name prefixes that players can optionally equip. Titles
may be gotten in various ways: donating, participating in events, getting 
advancements.
  
Titles are mostly managed through permissions. Titles are also split between
'tiers' (Now, these are basically permission groups)

## Editing/adding titles
Titles and tiers are declared in `.yml` files located in the `Titles` plugin's
directory.
