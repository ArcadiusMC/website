Usables are a system of interactive blocks/entities/items/trigger areas that are
able to run commands and other actions when a player interacts with them. This
system also allows you to place conditions on these usables, for example not
allowing anyone with less than 50,000 Denarii to use them.
  
This section of the admin Wiki will go over how to create usables, how to add
actions and conditions and cover some common issues that you may meet.
