## Events
Succession Events are monthly events in which players compete for the

title.
  
These events happen each month, and are always different. The same skills that 
may help you win an event, may hinder you in the next.
  
After winning, an

is crowned in the palace at *Latium*, where they're given their title, the 
*Emperor's Wreath*, a special wearable item that players keep forever.

## Benefits
As emperor, you can give your friends' player shops tax or rent exemptions, and
punish your foes' player shops with tax and rent increases. This can be done 
through *Magistrate Marius*, in the Imperial Palace at *Latium*. And, as the 
sovereign of the state, you don't have to pay any taxes or any rent on your own 
player shop.
  
Along with the powers over taxes and rent, you get titles exclusive to the 
current emperor:
