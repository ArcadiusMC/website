Waypoints are how players move around the server. Players can make their own and
name them.

## Using Waypoints
To use a waypoint, walk up to it, and Right-Click on the front sign. It will 
open up a waypoint list. You can click any of the listed waypoints to go to 
them.

## Creating your own waypoint
Use `/kit waypoints`. That will give you 2 Stone Bricks, 1 Chiselled Stone 
Bricks, and a Waypoint Creation Tool.

Then build a pillar of 2 Stone Bricks with the Chiselled Stone Bricks on top, 
like this:

Make sure the area around the waypoint is clear, and there's at least 2 free 
blocks in every direction.

Next, Right-Click the waypoint and it should transform into a real, functional 
waypoint.
