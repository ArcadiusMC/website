  Server world and data resets

{{<wikiimg src="/images/main/resets.png">}}

ArcadiusMC will be regularly reset roughly every 8 months. The world is 
completely reset, all player data is wiped and reset back to 0.
  
Players are allowed to keep any items of sentimental value (Trinkets, cards, some items)
and bring them with them into the next world. This happens close to the reset 
where players will be asked to submit their items (in shulkers) to be kept after
the reset.

Past worlds and such will be left available for download in the [ArcadiusMC 
Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LBANtxBD409u0xDS_QfcCX25Q-2pD40c?usp=sharing).
If you cannot download the entire world, you can ask for specific region files 
in the Discord.
