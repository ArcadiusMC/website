## Open positions

If you are interested in joining the staff team, we could use help in the 
following areas:
- **Coding:** helping with the server's custom plugins.
- **Artist:** creating server logo variants, PlanetMC server banner, server 
  texture packs, in-game cosmetics, webstore art, collector cards, and so on.
- **Writer:** helping to write the player wiki on complex features such as 
  dungeons, factions, custom items, and so on.
- **Server promotion:** bringing more attention to the server, for example 
  through Youtube, Twitch or TikTok.

## Owner
ArcadiusMC has no one "owner." Rather, ownership of the server is split between:

## Staff
This role is given to players that have proven to be of great use to the server.
Players earn it through activity and proving that they can be useful in one of 
the following areas:
- **Coding**: These players help create and maintain the server's custom plugins
  code. Their importance to the server cannot be overstated, but prepare to be
  bullied by Julie. *(I'm nice, I promise)*
- **Improving**: These players know how all features on the server work, know 
  how to improve them and can provide their help in the process. For example:
  balancing features or economy management.
- **Policing**: These players know about all the rules and punishments, how to 
  act maturely in conflicts and are able to diffuse sticky situations.
- **Building**: These players help build structures, events and more for the 
  server.

Players with this role have extra perms in-game, such as:
- Access to spectator and teleporting,
- Access to commands to punish players,
- Ignoring player claims,
- And more.


## Helper
Players earn it by helping the server out in various ways but are not part of 
the staff team. 
  
Players with this role do not have any extra perms in-game.
