  How to claim land and manage your claims
---

Players on ArcadiusMC can claim land using any golden shovel, and check for 
claims using any ole' stick. But you can get these tools with `/kit claim` as 
well.
  
## Creating claims
To create a claim, use the **Claim Shovel** and Right-Click at two points that 
will outline your claim.  
To resize any of your claims, Right-Click with the **Claim Shovel** on a corner
of an existing claim.
